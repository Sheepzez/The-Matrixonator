A program written in Python designed to deal with mathematical matrices, this is my first repo/foray in GitHub so it's also a test of that.

To Do:
- Change from using "Canvas" module for GUI to using proper Tkinter module

- Use this Tkinter module to display results inside the GUI, rather than relying on the Python shell

- Run performance tests on very large matrices (Find out if there are faster routes eg. dictionaries?)

- Add more functions. Suggestions?

Install Dependencies
====================
- Python 2.7


Currently runs from "The Matrixonator 9000.py".
